        <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 20%;" class="boxed">
            PC-Building involves both the construction of selected components and the selection of the components themselves.
            <br>
            PC-Building allows me to express creativity and innovative thinking by carefully selecting which component most optimally fits for a situation and
            allows me to use said creativity to optimize my creation.
            <br>
            Throughout 4 years I have repaired and constructed numerous desktop computers and laptops, including my personal computer.
        </p>

    <!-- Blender -->
    <div style=" position:absolute; width:100%; margin-top: 1550px; height: 600px;" id="Blender">
        <br>
        <h2 style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 50%;" class="boxed">BLENDER</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 20%;" class="boxed">
            Blender involves 3D-Modelling, animating and rendering. 
            <br>
            Because I deeply appreciate both expanding my knowledge in the IT hemisphere and learning new skills in order to use them in other projects, I took
            a liking towards 3D-Modelling. Like coding, 3D-Modelling is another way to turn concepts into reality and to nicely compliments any project involving both 3D-Modelling and
            coding.
            <br>
            Throughout 3 years I have both animated and 3D-Modelled meshes and animations most notably for games based on Unity.
        </p>

    <!-- C# -->
    <div style=" position:absolute; width:100%; margin-top: 2100px; height: 600px;" id="CSharp">    <br>
        <h2 style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 50%;" class="boxed">C#</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 20%;" class="boxed">
            Programming involves writing software solutions for any problem or project at hand and is another way of communicating directly with computers. 
            C# is one branch of the C family programming language, which is extensively used both professionally and by hobbyists for their projects.
            <br>
            Due to C# being another form of creative expression, being mainly based on logic and the groundwork of every other program and its purpose, I have decided for it to be my main professional direction.$
            A lot of concepts, whether they be games, automations, applications or projects, can be implemented with c# or any equivalent coding language, each with their own specialization. With it also being more localized 
            to a computer, like many of my other hobbies, I concentrate better and achieve a better workflow, due to it being my preferred way of working.
            <br>
            Throughout 2 years I have started a Unity course to lean the basics of both Unity and C# and worked on many projects within my current school.

    <!-- Image manipulation -->
    <div style="position:absolute; width:100%; margin-top: 2700px; height: 600px;" id="ImgMan">
        <br>
        <h2 style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 50%;" class="boxed">IMAGE MANIPULATION</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 20%;" class="boxed">
            Image manipulation involves editing a photo on a program.
            <br>
            Image manipulation, comparable to Blender and video editing, is localized within a single program and being another tool which I may use
            for any purpose I need, regardless if the use is professional or personal.
            <br>
            Throughout 3 years I have created many wallpaper images, profiles and other designs for myself to use.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Video editing -->
    <div style="position:absolute; width:100%; margin-top: 3300px; height: 600px;" id="VidMan">
        <br>
        <h2 style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 50%;" class="boxed">VIDEO EDITING</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 20%;" class="boxed">
            Video editing involves editing a video by manipulating a video with splicing, effects or any other ways to achieve the results needed.
            <br>
            Due to its similarity to image manipulation, getting to know video editing was a step which I was willing to take. While I do not work with videos
            as much as I do with any other hobby, I still appreciate owning the ability to add another skill to my skill set, due to it being versatile when needed to
            compliment another project.
            <br>
            Throughout 3 years I have made small snippets for various different purposes, mostly for personal use.
